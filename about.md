### Who am I?

I'm a software engineer (primary author of [GSL](https://github.com/imatix/gsl)) re-invented as a political science researcher (you can read my [PhD thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/11343/37678) or my [Wordpress blog](https://overseeingoverlooking.wordpress.com/)).

### About this project

This site is all about efforts to make software for qualitative research (so-called Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software – CAQDAS) the way it should be. That is:

1. Always available. Whenever you come across some data you should be able to add it to your project. No firing up some dedicated program (probably on your desktop computer as it’s too big to run on your phone/tablet/netbook). Just select and code as you go.

2. Portable. Use it on your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop.

3. Inter-operable. Share your work with others who use proprietary software like NVivo or free software like RQDA, Aquad or LibreQDA.

4. Open.  Use open standards whenever possible.

5. Free (like a bird).  Contribute, extend or modify it as you desire, just don’t try to lock it up. Our energies are better spent making better software than hiding what we have done from others.
