### Who am I?

I'm a software engineer (primary author of [GSL](https://github.com/imatix/gsl)) re-invented as a political science researcher (you can read my [PhD thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/11343/37678) or my [Wordpress blog](https://overseeingoverlooking.wordpress.com/)). My primary interest at this moment is in building software tools to make Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) simple for everyone.
