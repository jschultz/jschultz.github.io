### Who am I?

I'm a software engineer (primary author of [GSL](https://github.com/imatix/gsl)) re-invented as a political science researcher (you can read my [PhD thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/11343/37678) or my [Wordpress blog](https://overseeingoverlooking.wordpress.com/)).

### About this project

These github pages are a place for me to document my main project on building Free and Open Source tools for doing Qualitative Data Analysis. Plus other things that I do from time to time.
